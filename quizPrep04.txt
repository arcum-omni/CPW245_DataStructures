Quiz 4: BJP 16

16.1	What is the difference between a linked list and an array list?  How are they similar?
        An array list stores all its elements in a single large array, a linked list stores each element
        in its own container called a node.  The nodes are linked by reference.  They are similar in that
        they both behave the similarily to the client in terms of methods to add remove, get and locate elements.

16.2	What is the difference of a linked node and a linked list?  How are they related and connected?
        A node is a small object that stores a single element of a linked list.
        The list object stores references to a nodes such as the front of a list.
        The front container contains a chain of references connecting each element in the list.

16.3	What value is stored at the next field of the last node of a list?  What value will a node's next field have if none is
        specifiec?
        null, null

16.4	What happens if you, or the client, try to go past the last element in a linked list?  Be specific.
        The program will throw a null pointer exception

16.5	list --> [1|-]->[2|/]	list.next = new ListNode(3);
        list --> [1|-]->[3|/]

16.6	list --> [1|-]->[2|/]	list.next = new ListNode(3, list.next);
        list --> [1|-]->[3|-]->[2|/]

16.7	list --> [1|-]->[2|-]->[3|/]	list = new ListNode(4, list.next.next);
        list --> [4|-]->[3|/]

16.8	list --> [1|-]->[2|-]->[3|/]	list.next.next = null;
        list --> [1|-]->[2|/]
		
16.22	list --> [7|-]-> ... ->[16|/]  change all nodes to store 42  list --> [42|-]-> ... ->[42|/]

        ListNode current = list;
        while(current != null){
            current.data = 42;
            current = current.next;
        }
